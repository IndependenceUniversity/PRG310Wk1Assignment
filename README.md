A label will be used for the results of the calculation
You will be using a Response.Write() statement to print the value of the weight, height, and BMI variables. For each of these statements,
add sometime to explain what each value is for example;

Your Weight is 'xxx' pounds

The formula that you will be using to calculate the BMI value is;

(Weight * 703) / (Height * Height)
